        <p><em>IT Helpdesk Analyst at <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/">UCSF</a>.</em></p>
        <p>I'm currently an IT Helpdesk Analyst at UCSF where my days consist of assisting technical and non-technical users. I provide technical support and ensure the company runs smoothly by maintaining network and computer systems. Most recently I was a Documentation Specialist at PayPal on the Risk Assessment team. I worked closely with SME's to gather, update and document Information Security controls, processes and obligations in order to pass the annual Risk Assessment. I graduated as a Cyber Security Trainee at Year Up, an intensive IT program that strives to build a bridge between the Urban Community and Corporate America. I am currently a student at Flatiron School enrolled in the Software Engineering bootcamp. I'm self-driven and always looking for new learning opportunities.</p>

        <p>It is my goal to put my technical skills and passion to good use by working for companies that share the same values as me. </p></td>
